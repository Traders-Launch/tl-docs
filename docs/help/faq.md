## Evaluation Rules

### What happens if I hit the daily loss limit?

Your account will be automatically liquidated for the day. You can resume trading the next trading day. Hitting the daily loss limit does not fail your evaluation unless it causes you to breach the trailing drawdown.

### How does the trailing drawdown work?

The trailing drawdown follows your account's highest balance:
- It trails up as you make profit
- Once it reaches your starting balance, it locks and stops trailing
- If your balance falls below the threshold, you fail the evaluation

### Can I hold positions overnight?

- **During evaluation:** No, all positions must be closed by market close
- **Once funded:** Yes, but with reduced position sizes

### Is there a time limit to pass?

No. Take as long as you need to reach the profit target while following the rules.
