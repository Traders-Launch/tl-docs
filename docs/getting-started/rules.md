# Trading Rules

Understanding and following these rules is essential to passing your evaluation and maintaining your funded account.

## Daily Loss Limit

Your account cannot lose more than the daily loss limit in a single trading day.

- Calculated from the day's starting balance
- Includes both realized and unrealized P&L
- Resets at 5:00 PM CT daily

**Example:** If your daily loss limit is $1,000 and you start the day at $50,000, your account cannot drop below $49,000.

## Trailing Drawdown

The trailing drawdown follows your account's high-water mark.

- Starts from your initial balance
- Trails up as your account grows
- Locks at your starting balance once reached

**Example:** With a $2,500 trailing drawdown on a $50,000 account:
- Starting threshold: $47,500
- If account grows to $52,000, new threshold: $49,500
- Once threshold reaches $50,000, it locks and stops trailing
